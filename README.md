# Data-Analyzing-Wisconsin-Police-Activity-using-pandas

We'll be analyzing a dataset of traffic stopped by police in __Wisconsin__ that was collected by the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/). It is about __1 million__ data recorded from _2010 to 2016_. We may need to careful about the data size; i.e if We have large dataset, Our local machine may not be able to support.

### Things that we want to find out
1. In term of top traffic violation, is there a difference in gender? Many people believe that gender has an impact on whether the driver will receive a ticket or a warning. Is this true?
2. During a traffic stop, the police officer sometimes conducts a search of the vehicle. Does gender make difference for search?
3. When is the peak traffic police activity?
4. In a small portion of traffic stops, drugs are found in the vehicle during a search. Is it in rising trend? Does more search lead to discovery of more drugs found?
